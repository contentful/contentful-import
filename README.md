[https://www.contentful.com](Contentful) is a content management platform for web applications, mobile apps and connected devices. It allows you to create, edit & manage content in the cloud and publish it anywhere via powerful API. Contentful offers tools for managing editorial teams and enabling cooperation between organizations.

This Command Line Tool (CLI) helps you to import files generated by the [contentful-export](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-export) tool to new and empty Contentful spaces.

## Installation

We recommend you install the CLI via npm:

```bash
npm install -g contentful-import
```

## Usage and examples

```shell
Usage: bin/contentful-import [options]

Options:
  --version                 Show version number [number]
  --space-id                ID of the destination space [string] [required]
  --management-token        Management API token for the destination space [string] [required]
  --content-file            json file that contains data to be import to your space [string] [required]
  --skip-content-model      Skips content types and locales. Copies only entries and assets [boolean]
  --skip-content-publishing Skips content publishing. Creates content but does not publish it [boolean]
  --skip-locales            Skips locales. Must be used with content-model-only. Copies only content-types [boolean]
  --config                  Configuration file with required values
```

### Example

```shell
contentful-import \
  --space-id spaceID \
  --management-token managementToken \
  --content-file exported-file.json \
```

or

```shell
contentful-import --config example-config.json
```

You can create your own configuration file based on the [_example-config.json_](example-config.json) file.

### Usage as a library

While this tool is intended for use as a command line tool, you can also use it as a Node library:

```javascript
let spaceImport = require('contentful-import')
let options = {
    content: {entries:..., contentTypes:..., locales:...},
    spaceId: 'SPACE_ID',
    managementToken: 'MANAGEMENT_TOKEN'
}
spaceImport(options)
.then((output) => {
  console.log('Data Imported successfully')
})
.catch((err) => {
  console.log('oh no! errors occurred!', err)
})
```

## Limitations

- This tool imports only your published Content Model, Content and Assets. It will support Editor Interfaces, Webhooks and Roles & Permissions in a future version. Draft entries are not supported.
- You can only import content to an empty space. It does not support merging content into pre-existent spaces.
- If you have custom widgets, you need to reinstall them manually in the new space.
